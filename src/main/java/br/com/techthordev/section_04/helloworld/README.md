# 01 – Hello World

This module contains my first Java exercises from Section 4 of the Java Masterclass.  
It focuses on getting comfortable with IntelliJ IDEA, basic Java syntax, and running simple programs.

---

## 🚀 Topics Covered

- Setting up IntelliJ IDEA
- Creating a Java project and running the first program
- Understanding the `main` method
- Basic printing to the console
- Working with simple classes

## 📂 Structure

```bash
src/main/java/
Hello.java
FirstClass.java
SecondClass.java
```


Each file contains small practice examples used to explore the basics of Java.

## 🎯 Purpose

This module serves as the foundation for the rest of the course.  
The main goal is to get familiar with:

- how Java programs are structured
- how IntelliJ builds and runs code
- navigating the Java toolchain (compiler, output, project files)

⭐ More modules will follow as I progress through the Java Masterclass.
